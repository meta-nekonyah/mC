# mC
Meta C. It's C but more pleasant to work with.

#C without the need for:
  - Terminating the end of lines with semicolons/;.
  - Brackets to group things, grouping is done via indentation liike Python.

#To use it:
gcc -o mC mc.c


#What needs to be worked on
// comments inline of code
/**/ comments in line of code

#Some more Nicities coming later
  -One will not need to prototype functions.
